    "### What is supervised machine learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning is a multidisciplinary science that aims at enabling machines to solve complex problems explicitely coding the decision making process. For example, predicting the conversion rate on a website or the price of real estate are problems that can be solved by optimizing machine learning models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Supervised machine learning** is a branch of this discipline that consists in solving problems for which there are already solved examples. For instance, data is being collected on a sample of housing units in San Francisco that describe their location, various characteristics and the rent price. If our problem is to estimate the rent price for a dwelling in the same city that is not already in our database, we will build a model from our data that estimates the rent based on the characteristics of the dwellings and apply this model to the unknown dwelling to estimate its rent price. This is a typical example of a supervised learning problem, because when the model was built, the values of the **variable** to be estimated were known, we call it the **target variable**."

    "### Why should you use machine learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a problem has been indetified, a target variable has been selected, and a number of explanatory variables have been collected, the objectives of supervised statistical modelling fall into three broad, non-exclusive categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Description: we can try to understand the relations that exist between the target variable \"Y\" and the explanatory variables \"X1, ..., Xp\" in order to select the most relevant ones or to visualize the behaviors in the observed samples.\n",
    "* Explanation: when you have expert knowledge on the data used for your machine learning problem, for example in economics or biology for example, the objective is to build a test that allows you to verify or confirm theoretical results in practical situations.\n",
    "* Prediction: here we focus on the quality of the estimators and predictors, we do not necessarily try to understand the observed population as well as possible, but to build a model that allows us to produce reliable predictions for future observations.\n"

    "## Revision : linear regressions\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we will focus on **regression models**, that's any machine learning model that allow us to estimate a numerical and **continuous** target variable. We will focus on the concrete example of real estate prices in Boston, using a dataset provided in the scikit learn package from python.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Simple linear regressions\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple linear regression models are based on the following linear equation :\n",
    "\n",
    "## $E(Y) = f(X) = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}X_1$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### OR\n",
    "\n",
    "## $Y = \\beta_{0} + \\beta_{1}X_1 + \\epsilon$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, $Y$ represents the target variable, i.e. the variable whose value we wish to estimate, $X_1$ is the explanatory variable we have chosen to estimate the target variable. $\\beta_0$, $\\beta_{1}$, $\\epsilon$ are respectively the intercept (i.e. level 0 of $Y$ when $X$ is 0), the coefficient associated with $X_1$ (it is the parameter of the model that measures the influence of $X_1$ on $Y$, if $X$ increases by 1, $Y$ will increase by $\\beta_{1}$), and the error or residue of the model. The above equation is the representation of a statistical model: it is true on average but does not claim to be exact, which explains the presence of the residual $\\epsilon$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the samples in your dataset (see scatter plot below), your model will find the line that comes as close as possible to all the dots on average. Here's what it looks like visually:\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Dependent variables\n",
    "\n",
    "In Machine Learning, we always distinguish between the **dependent variable/target variable** and **independent variables/explanatory variables.** The dependent variable is the element you are trying to predict. In the equation above, this corresponds to $Y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Independent Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "The independent variables, represented by $X_i$ ($i$ is an index that indicates the position of the column in a dataset) are your predictors or factors that will be used to determine the value of $Y$. For example, if we try to predict someone's salary based on their years of experience. The independent variable $X_i$ corresponds to the number of years of experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Coefficient\n",
    "\n",
    "The $\\beta_{1}$ coefficient represents the _slope_ or weight your independent variable will have in your equation. Like we mentionned before, the practical interpretation of $\\beta_1$ is the following : if $X_1$ increases by $1$, $Y$ is **expected** to increase by $\\beta_1$. The term **expected** is really important here, remember that any machine learning model is meant to be statistically as good as possible, which means that it is meant to perform the best on average across all given training samples and does not necessarily predicts all individual samples perfectly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Constant\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the constant $\\beta_{0}$ represents where your line will start if $X = 0$. In the context of predicting wages in relation to years of experience, even at 0 years of experience ($X = 0$), the starting minimum wage will be expected to be different from 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Residual\n",
    "\n",
    "The residual, often noted $\\epsilon$ corresponds to the error committed during modeling. This error corresponds to all the information that is not explained by the model. It is often assumed that the error follows a particular law of probability in order to justify modeling the data with specific kinds of machine learning models.\n"

    "### Assumptions behind linear regression\n",
    "\n",
    "When building an ML model, you should be aware of the assumptions you are making in order for your model to work well. Otherwise, you will have a poor performance. Remember that traditional machine learning is all based on statistics, which is a sub-section of mathematics, and is an **exact** science, therefore all models that we will study in this module are backed by statistical theory and mathematical proofs that define the theoretical context in which the model can be optimised with certainty. It is very common for these assumptions not to be true in practical contexts, however in most cases, models can still be used, and derive useful results despite all hypothesis being verified. The assumptions needed for a simple linear regression model are the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Linearity\n",
    "\n",
    "The first assumption is simple. You need your points to follow roughly a straight line. In other words, you need to ensure that your dependent variable grows linearly as your independent variables increase.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Homoscedasticity\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming the first assumption is holding and your samples follow a linear dependence between $Y$ and $X_1$, homoscedasticity introduces an assumption on the statistical distribution of the residual $\\epsilon$. Homoscedasticity means that your residuals need to show constant variance accross all possible values of $Y$. If $\\epsilon$ take small values when $Y$ is small and large values when $Y$ is large, then homoscedasticity is not verified.\n",
    "\n",
    "This hypothesis is important in theory in order to mathematically solve the linear regression equation we showed you before, however it does not prevent your model to prove useful in practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Independence of residuals\n",
    "\n",
    "The residuals need to be independent from each other. Independence is a very difficult characteristic to verify in practice, therefore it is frequently replaced with absence of autocorrelation (which means correlation with itself). For example if residuals for small values of $Y$ tend to be all negative and residuals for larger values of $Y$ tend to be all positive, that indicates autocorrelation of residuals, which we wish to avoid.\n"

    "## Estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "Estimation techniques are the methods that we use to calculate the optimal parameters of the model so the residuals are as little as possible accross all data. Here we will introduce two different techniques that can be used to optimize a simple linear regression model, you do not need to know this by heart but rather understand the general logic behind them which roughly goes as follows : we choose a function that needs to be minimized of maximized which is directly linked to the model's equation, this is called the loss function when we need to minimize it, and the likelihood when we need to maximize it. Loss functions usually represent the \"cost\" of prediction errors that wewish to minimize and the likelihood is a probability distribution connecting the target variable to the explanatory variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Maximizing Likelihood\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "The likelihood of a family of random variables is a function that gives for each possible realisation of each $β_1$ and $X_{1}$ random variable in the family the probability that this combination of realisations will occur. In the case of statistical modelling, data are already available, so we already know the realizations of each random variable (i.e. the value of the explanatory variables for each observation). It is therefore a matter of finding the parameters that will make the observations available to us as likely as possible. In other words, we are trying to find the underlying general rule that we suspect exists behind the oberved distribution of data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Statistical likelihood is a function of conditional probabilities (it is a probability whose law depends on parameters). Let $X = (X_{1}, X_{2}, ..., X_{n})$, a vector of random variables and $\\theta = (\\beta_{1}, \\beta_{2}, ..., \\beta_{k})$ of the set of parameters on which $X$ depends. In what follows, capital letters represent the random variables i.e. $X_i$ and the lowercase represent secific realisations of thoses random variables $X_i = x_i$. With that in mind, the likelihood of $Y$ is written:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### $L(Y)=L(x_{1},x_{2},...x_{p}) = \\prod^{n}_{i=1}f(x_{i};\\beta)$\n",

    "With\n",
    "\n",
    "if x is a continuous variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "### $f(x_{i};\\Beta) = f_{\\beta}(x_{i})$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $f$ is the density probability function for $X_i$, and $\\Beta$ represents the parameters $\\beta_1, \\beta_2, ..., \\beta_p$.\n",
    "\n",
    "if x is a discret variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "### $f(x_{i};\\Theta) = P_{\\beta}(x_{i})$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $P$ is the probability of getting $X_i = x_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Maximum likelihood estimate\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to estimate the parameters of a model is to maximize the corresponding likelihood function. In the case of simple linear regression, this function is:\n",
    "\n",
    "### $L(Y = y|\\beta) = \\prod_{i=1}^{n}f(Y_{i} = y_{i}|\\beta)$\n",
    "\n",
    "### $L(Y = y|\\beta) = \\prod_{i=1}^{n}f(\\beta_{0} + \\beta_1 x_1i + \\epsilon = y_{i}|\\beta_{0}, \\beta_{1})$\n",
    "\n",
    "### $L(Y = y|\\beta) = \\prod_{i=1}^{n}f(\\epsilon = y_{i}-\\beta_{0}-\\beta_{1}x_{i}|\\beta_{0}, \\beta_{1}$\n",
    "\n",
    "### $L(Y = y|\\beta) = \\prod_{i=1}^{n}\\frac{1}{\\sigma\\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\exp(\\frac{-(y_{i}-\\beta_{0}-\\beta_{1}x_{i})^2}{2\\sigma^2})$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This likelihood equation can be obtained by assuming that the error $\\epsilon$ follows a centred normal law ($E(\\epsilon) = \\mu = 0$) of standard deviation $\\sigma$. We must therefore find the maximum (if it exists) of this likelihood function. To do this we apply a logarithm to each side of the equation to obtain a sum rather than a product.\n",
    "\n",
    "### $log(L(Y = y|\\beta)) = log(\\prod^{n}_{i=1}\\frac{1}{\\sigma \\sqrt{2\\pi}}\\exp(\\frac{-(y_{i}-\\beta_{0}-\\beta_{1}x_{1})^2}{2\\sigma^2}))$\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that the equation depends only on the parameters of the model: $β_0$ and $β_1$ and we still have to find the values for which $-\\sum^{n}_{i=1}(y_{i}-\\beta_{0}-\\beta_{1}x_{i})^2$ is maximal.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The ordinary least square method (commonly referred to as OLS)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "You are probably wondering how we know that the line in our model is the one that is the \"closest\" to each of the points in our dataset. Well, it's because of the \"ordinary least square\" method. We're not going to demonstrate the method all the way. What you have to understand is that the algorithm will look for the minimum possible distance between each point in your graph using this formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "### $Min (\\sum_{i=0}^{n}(y_{i}-\\hat{y}_{i})^2)$\n",
    "\n",
    "We are looking for the set of parameters that will minimize the sum of square errors between the target variable and the prediction. This is actually your first encounter with a **loss function**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### $Min (\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_{i}-\\beta{0}-\\beta_{1}x_{i})^2)$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of simple linear regression, maximum likelihood or least square estimation is equivalent in terms of finding the optimal set of parameters. However the concept of loss function is becoming more popular, expecially with the rise of deep learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this equation, $y_{i}$ represents the value of the target variable $Y$ for each sample (or row) in your dataset while $\\hat{y}_{i}$ represents your model's prediction.\n",

In other words, SST is the total amount of information, SSE is the information explained by the model and SSR is the information that remains to be explained, or the error committed.\n",

    "\n",
    "A statistical test is a process by which we try to show whether a hypothesis is confirmed or disproved by the data at our disposal. This test hypothesis, also called null hypothesis and noted $H_{0}$, would have consequences on the properties of the observed data if it is actually verified. These properties are summarized by a test statistic, the value of which gives an idea of the probability that H_0 is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fisher's F-statistic allows to test the veracity of the following hypotheses:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* When the Fisher test is applied to the model as a whole, the null hypothesis, noted $H_{0}$, is \"the variables chosen to construct the model are not jointly significant in describing the target variable\". If the hypothesis is true, the F-statistic should follow a Fisher probability distribution law noted F-distribution of parameters $(n - 1, n - 1)$ where $n$ is the number of observations used to train the model. However, if the value of the F-statistic, noted \"F\", is outside the most probable regions of the distribution, then we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the chosen model has a real explanatory power on the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "It may seem a little farfetched but all statistical tests work like that. We make an assumption, this assumption if it held would cause the test statistic to follow a given distribution, if the actual value of the statistic lands too far from the probable scope of the hypothetical distribution we are allowed to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, the F-statistic is written:\n",
    "\n",
    "### $F$ $ = \\frac{SSE}{SSR}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The F-test can also compare two nested models (model 1 which includes \"model_1_variables\" and model 2 which includes \"model_1_variables + $X_d$\". In this case the F-statistic follows an F-law of parameters $(n - 1, n - 1)$ if the assumption that the simplest model (model 1) of the two models best describes the target variable is verified. The mathematical formula of F is then :\n",
    "\n",
    "### $F = (\\frac{SSR_{2}-SSR_{1}}{p_{2}-p_{1}})(\\frac{n-p_{1}}{SSR_{1}})$\n",
    "\n",
    "If the value of F-statistic is in an unlikely region of the F-distribution, then the hypothesis is rejected and the test suggests that the more complex Model 2 provides significant additional information compared to the simpler Model 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Graphically the F-test can be illustrated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1KKDqtiiimdfHZK59JkZ2wyvDOQUJA8ER)\n",
    "\n",
    "In black, we represent the density distribution of the F-distribution, as in any test we define a level $\\alpha$ between 0 and 1 which will influence the size of the hypothesis rejection zone. Very often, we choose $\\alpha = 5%$ when no specific knowledge can help us modulate our standards. The F test is one-sided, only large values of F will allow us to reject the hypothesis. More precisely if the value of F is in the upper part of the expected distribution equivalent to 5% probability, then we can say that the hypothesis is rejected at $1 - \\alpha$ 95%.\n",
    "\n",
    "This first metric allows us to test the hypothesis that the explanatory variables have no influence on the target variable, we will now look at metrics that indicate the performance level of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "* $R^{2}$ (R square)\n",
    "\n",
    "$R^{2}$, or R-squared, is a statistic that quantifies the explanatory power of the model with respect to the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### $R^{2} = 1-\\frac{SSR}{SST}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$R^2$ monotonically increases with each additional explanatory variable. It varies between 0 and 1, if the model is not very relevant, the sum of the residual squares $SSR$ will be close to the sum of the total squares $SST$ and $R^{2}$ will be closer to 0, on the contrary, if the model allows to explain the target variable faithfully, then $SSR$ will be closer to 0 and $R^2$ will be closer to 1. So mechanically, with each addition of variable to the model, the prediction of $Y$, the target variable, will be better and $R^2$ will be higher. In fact, $R^2$ is a performance indicator that only allows to compare two models that have the same number of explanatory variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "* $R^2_{adjusted}$\n",
    "\n",
    "$R^2_{adjusted}$ is a modified version of $R²$ that penalizes the number of explanatory variables selected to build the model. Its mathematical formula is:\n",
    "\n",
    "### $R^2_{ajusted} = 1-\\frac{n-1}{n-p-1}(1-R^2)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $p$ is the number of explanatory variables used and $n$ is the number of observations used. The growth of $R^2$ as a function of $p$ is compensated by the decrease of $\\frac{n-1}{(n-p-1)}$ as a function of $p$. Consequently, if the information contribution of an explanatory variable is not significant enough, then $R^2_{adjusted}$ will decrease. In fact, it is possible to use this indicator to compare the performance of models that do not necessarily have the same number of explanatory variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "* P-values\n",
    "\n",
    "P-values are evaluation metrics that make it possible to evaluate the contribution of each explanatory variable individually as opposed to evaluating the model as a whole. Unfortunately it cannot be easily computed using sklearn so we will introduce the statsmodels library that calculates all important metrics automatically. The p_value can be interpreted as the probability that a given parameter's true value is 0, in other words the probability that a variable does not bring any significant information to the linear model. Usually we consider that a p_value inferior to 5% means that the variable is significant, otherwise it is consider not significant, however it depends on the context and the standards of the industry you are working in : for example web marketing agencies typically have lower standards than pharmaceutical companies because their goals and constraints are fundamentally different.\n",
