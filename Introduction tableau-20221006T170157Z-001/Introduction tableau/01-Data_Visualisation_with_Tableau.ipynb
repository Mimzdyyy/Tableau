    "\n",
    "### Setting up Tableau 🎡\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several versions of Tableau. One is called Tableau Desktop, another is called Tableau Online, and yet another is called Tableau Server. For our course we will be using the open source version of Tableau Desktop called Tableau Public. Here are the steps to install the tool:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Go to [https://public.tableau.com](https://public.tableau.com)\n",
    "* Enter your email and download Tableau.\n",
    "* If it did not start automatically, go to your email and look up for a welcome email from Tableau. You will see a download link.\n",

    "### Importing data into Tableau 🗂️\n",
    "\n",
    "With Tableau, you can import almost any type of file. We will mainly use Excel sheets but you can see that there are other versions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* _Text_ files, which correspond to `.txt` or `.csv` files.\n",
    "* The _JSON_ files that are often used among web developers (`.json` extension).\n",
    "* Spatial files that correspond to geographic data (such as maps)  🌎\n",
    "* Statistical files like SPSS (software created by IBM).\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on your company, you will handle different types of files. However, most of the time, you will be using Excel or CSV.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NB:** CSV (or Comma Separated Values) files are files where each column is separated by a comma. It is very common to make mistakes because a comma has been misplaced. So be extremely careful that your data has been cleaned up otherwise Tableau will not read your file properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "After opening Tableau, click on the type of file you want to import:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1OKsB3veuZtxL47GrzL1NQkdXKPrVIrfI)\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Accessing graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "For those who are familiar with Excel, Tableau is likewise structured. \n",
    "\n",
    "* A graph is contained within a _Sheet_. 🪆\n",
    "* Several _sheets_ are contained within _Dashboards. 🪆🪆\n",
    "* And  finally, a _dashboard_ can be inserted within a _Story_ whose purpose is to present analysis. 🪆🪆🪆\n",
    "\n",
    "To build a graph, click on a sheet. Then the interface to build a graph will appear:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1Gw7L5uiqrLkK-VrmHGxpgZ-uyIHY-qoa)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**NB:** You can rename the sheet by double-clicking on it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Measures & Dimensions 📏\n",
    "\n",
    "_Measures_ and _Dimensions_ represent different type of data in Tableau. _Measures_ correspond to quantitative data while _Dimensions_ correspond to qualitative data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tableau will always try to guess if a given variable is a *measure* or a *dimension*. And generally it does not get it wrong. However, you will always be able to change them in the tool if this should happen. 👍\n",
    "\n",
    "In Tableau, _measures_ and _dimensions_ are on the left side of the interface:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1SvEUmAq0oIEc10KZbb3dCQmUKMDovMb0)\n",
    "\n",
    "**NB:** Sometimes it may be necessary to change a data type from _measure_ to _dimension_ or vice-versa. You can do this very simply by dragging and dropping the corresponding _measure_ to the _dimensions_ section.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Creating your first graph 📈\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating a graph is very simple with Tableau. Simply drag and drop a measure and dimension into the _columns_ and _lines_ of the sheet.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1qdLSB9OdRwcvPbF-3raoOYnNq78eixqq)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**NB:** It is not mandatory to put dimensions in columns and measurements in rows. It all depends on the visual purpose of the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Calculated Fields 🧮\n",
    "\n",
    "Often your raw data is not sufficient for what you want to create. For example, you might need to apply taxes on a gross margin variable 💰. This is where you will be using calculated fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the _measures_ section, right-click and select, \"_create a calculated field..._\" You will then have to give a name to your field and do your calculation. The formulas work the same way as Excel (\"_*_\" for multiplication \"_/_\" for division).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to use pre-existing _measures_ to create a _calculated field, you will type the name of your measure in the table. The first few letters will be enough for Tableau to suggest it to you, just click on it.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Colors 🎨\n",
    "\n",
    "It may seem trivial and yet it's often forgotten, colors are important in Data Visualisation because they will help your audience understand your results easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to change colors in your graph, click on \"_colors_\" in the _Benchmarks_ section and choose the one that suits you. \n",
    "\n",
    "We advise you to keep color coding simple: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Red often signifies danger or things that you must be careful about. ⛔\n",
    "* Green is often a sign of serenity or money, while blue is a neutral colour that most people like. 💸\n",
    "\n",
    "In case you want to separate colors according to dimensions (e.g. one colour per region in your graph), you can drag your dimension and drop it in the _Benchmarks_ section.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://essentials-assets.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/M01-Data_visualisation/D01-Data_visualisation/colors.gif)\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Labels 🏷️\n",
    "\n",
    "You can add labels to your graphs. This is useful when you want to add clarity to your presentations. Remember that people in your audience did not participate in your analyses, and discover your results at the moment of your presentation, so you need to be clear and not think they will guess anything you won't be presenting.\n",
    "\n",
    "To add a label, go to the _Benchmarks_ section and click on _Labels_. You can customize it in any way you like. You can also drag a _size_ or _measure_ to automatically update your graph.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you may want to change the format of your labels. For example, you may want to show a monetary value rather than just a number. To do this, you can right-click and select \"_format..._\". Click on \"axis\" to the left of the tool and you can change the format of your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Export your work 🎁\n",
    "\n",
    "If you use Tableau Public, you are limited in terms of export. So you can simply take a screenshot *(shift + cmd + 4 on mac)*\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also save your work to Tableau Public. Your graphs will in Tableau public repositories. Everybody will be able to checkout your work but you will be able to go back to whenever you want. \n",

    "### Visualisation of an A/B Test 💕\n",
    "\n",
    "To visualise an A/B test quickly on Tableau, you only need to remember two things:\n",
    "\n",
    "* First, you need to use different colors so that your audience can tell the difference between your control variable and your variation. To do so:\n",
    "    * Simply drag your dimension on \"_Colors_\" in the _Marks_ section. \n",
    "    * Then you will add labels to clarify the results of each variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The second thing is how to convert numbers into percentages. To do this:\n",
    "    * You will have to click on the drop-down menu on your measure (look for the arrow on the right side of the measer) and then select \"_Add Table calculation_\". \n",
    "    * In the table calculation, choose \"_percentage of total_\" and then select \"_Table Vertical_\" in the _calculation using_ section. This will give you a percentage of the total result.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://essentials-assets.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/M01-Data_visualisation/D01-Data_visualisation/AB_test.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "These two techniques are a quick way to visualize an A/B Test. Be careful however, ⚠️ **this does not show the statistical significance of the A/B test** ⚠️. You will have to do a [Chi2 test](http://www.evanmiller.org/ab-testing/chi-squared.html) to know the real statistical significance of your test.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Working with Aliases 🤡\n",
    "\n",
    "Often you will need to overwrite your default values in your measures to be clearer. For example, if you have binary measures like 0 or 1, it is best to replace this with \"clicked\" / \"didn't click\" or \"bought\" / \"didn't buy\".\n",
    "\n",
    "To add an alias, simply right-click on your measure or dimension and select *Edit Alias*. A window will appear and you can replace the values with whatever you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://essentials-assets.s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/M01-Data_visualisation/D01-Data_visualisation/Edit_aliases.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "Changing the values with an alias will not change the values in your database. It simply brings clarity to your graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reference Line 🎼\n",
    "\n",
    "Adding a reference line is useful when you want to compare your results with your competitors or with your past results. For example, if you want to analyze your income for the year, you may want to compare it to the average income generated by your competitors. This average revenue will be what your baseline is.\n",
    "\n",
    "To add a reference line, right click on your Y-axis and select \"_Add Reference Line_\". You will then have several options, you can take a single line, a band, a distribution or a boxplot. Depending on what you need, you will choose the one you want.\n",
